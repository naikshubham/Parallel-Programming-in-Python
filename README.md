# Parallel-Programming-in-Python
Python is now well established as a major platform for data analysis and data science. For many data scientists, the largest limitation of Python is that all data must fit into the resident memory of the available workstation. Further, traditionally, Python has only been able to utilize one CPU. Data scientists constantly ask, "How can I read and process large amounts of data?" and "How can I make use of more computational processing resources?" 
Let's explore Dask, multiprocessing etc.
